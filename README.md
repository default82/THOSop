# THOSop - The Homelab Operating System on Proxmox

**THOSop** (The Homelab Operating System on Proxmox) is a project aimed at creating a fully automated and secure homelab environment using Proxmox VE, specifically tailored for ARM64-based systems like the Raspberry Pi 4.

## Goal

The goal of THOSop is to provide an easy-to-use, fully automated system that allows users to set up and manage a homelab environment with minimal manual intervention. The system is designed to:

- **Automate the installation and configuration of Proxmox VE** across multiple machines in a network.
- **Securely manage and store configuration data and credentials**, ensuring that sensitive information is protected.
- **Provide a responsive web interface** for managing the homelab environment, allowing for easy configuration and monitoring of services.
- **Utilize infrastructure-as-code tools** like Terraform and Ansible to automate the provisioning and management of services.
- **Implement a bastion server and DNS management** to facilitate secure access and streamlined network configuration.
